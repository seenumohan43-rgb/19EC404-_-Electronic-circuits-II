### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 =5hz |f1" =3.5hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 =1.5khz |f2" =550khz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | BW = f2-fl =1.495mhz | BW = f2" - f1" =546.5khz |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain |  Avmid = 26.52 |  Av"mid = 11.12 |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |Go=18.75  | Go"=7.86 |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
