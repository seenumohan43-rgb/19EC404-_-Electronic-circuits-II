## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 = 0.0170hz |f1" 0.065hz|
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 = 110hz |f2" = 1000hz|
| 3 | Bandwidth |  BW = f2 - fl = 109.98hz | BW = f2"-f1 = 997.935hz |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain |  Av mid =1.12v  |  Av"mid = 940mv|
| 5 | Gain at half power point | Go 0.79 | Go" =0.66 |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
